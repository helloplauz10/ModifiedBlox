A Python-based terminal app used for modifying and using Roblox deeply.

This project is a **MacOS** alternative to [Bloxstrap](https://github.com/pizzaboxer/bloxstrap) but instead this program uses ncurses and is only accessible using a Terminal app

**This program does not touch nor modify Roblox's memory.**

# Working on:
* Modify Fast Flags ✅
* Modify Textures/Sound Effects (Revert back to the old death sound / Custom Cursor) ✅
* Get the location of the server you're connected to ✅
* Rejoin the last game you played
* Fast Flags and Modified Textures retain after updating ✅
