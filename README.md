# A DEMO OF REDEFINE ROBLOX. STILL NOT RELEASED
An alternative bootstrapper for Roblox and an unofficial [Bloxstrap](https://github.com/pizzaboxer/bloxstrap) alternative for MacOs. Great for configuring Roblox's resources without breaking Roblox's Terms of Service

Credits to [Proton0](https://github.com/Proton0/Roblox-Configurator) for letting me use his functions in this project

# Features
* Modify Fast Flags
* Modify Textures/Sound Effects (Revert back to the old death sound / Custom Cursor)
* Get the location of the server you're connected to
* Tail the game's console log without entering console
* Rejoin the last game you just played
* Fast Flags and Modified Textures remain after updating

### Unfortunately, launching two Roblox instances isn't still supported and attempt to do so will just confuse Redefiner's Activity Monitor.

# Installing
Clone this Respository and run installrr.py

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/helloplauz10/RedefineRoblox
$ cd RedefineRoblox
$ python3 RedefineRoblox
```
This will automatically install the requirements needed and put RedefineRoblox at an executable path (~/RedefineRoblox/execs/)
